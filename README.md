# Protocol

Protocols represent agreed-upon interaction patterns that, through their limitations or constraints, unlock new freedoms and possibilities. By consciously defining and adhering to effective protocols, a collective can achieve desired outcomes more efficiently and effectively. For example, the golden rule—treat others as you would like to be treated—is a social protocol that governs interaction patterns in the social field. 

A more technical example is the blockchain protocol, which sets rules allowing for secure, decentralized transactions. The entirety of the Web3 space exemplifies the new levels of collective coordination achievable through this potent protocol.

At FunCity we want to be conscious about this concept and how it lies at the root for scalable coordination so that we can explicitly find and employ increasingly more elegant and coherent protocols aligned with our mission.
